# 🐚 Bash Scripting Practice

This repository contains a collection of Bash scripts I created while learning shell scripting. It's a mix of basic utilities, command-line experiments, and small automations built for practice and exploration.

## 🎯 Purpose

- Reinforce foundational Linux and Bash skills
- Automate simple tasks
- Document my learning process


## 🚀 How to Use

```bash
